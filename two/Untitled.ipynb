    "Suppose you are asked to write a simple game involving a spaceship and an asteroid. The spaceship and an asteroid have a position and orientation in a 2D plane. The aim of the game is for the spaceship to fire a missile at the asteroid and destroy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe or draw a software design for this game.\n",
    "    * this may include a system diagram, flow chart, class diagram, etc.\n",
    "    * State any assumptions you make.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Writing this game involves thinking about three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The engine, which we'll call `Game` - Responsible for operating the core logic of the game, such as moving pieces. Advanced engines will have renderers (which we simulate here with a `render` method), as well as code for handling the interaction between various game objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* The front-end - Omitted. This will usually be the part that handles user input (like a webpage, or a C++ UI), which makes calls to the engine and renders the result. Here, our input is nothing, and our output is the console!\n",
    "\n",
    "* The game objects - How do we represent the pieces involved? In this doc, we'll make an object which encapsulates the idea of a 2D point which has its own velocity and orientation.\n",
    "    * `Asteroid` - Moves in a straight line, spawns randomly\n",
    "    * `Missile` - Moves in a straight line. Has a max range. When it hits an asteroid, they both disappear\n",
    "    * `Spaceship` - Can accelerate in 2D, change its orientation, and fire a missile\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "#### Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Game` is responsible for handling user input and moving the objects in the game\n",
    "\n",
    "* `init()` - inits a spaceship and asteroid.\n",
    "* `update()` - moves everything, checks for collisions\n",
    "* `user_input(c)` - tells the spaceship to turn and accelerate. Also can fire a missile\n",

    "- Collision checking - since the number of objects is small, no dedicated techniques (like quadtrees, or sorting) to reduce teh load\n",
    "- space is infinite\n",
    "- however, `Spaceship` will have a max speed\n",
    "- the thing that calls `user_input` will be defined by the user - this can be a webpage, another program, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game objects\n",
    "\n",
    "All three things can `move()`. In addition, `Spaceship` can `turn(x)` and `accelerate(x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "- Based on the simple 1-asteroid scenario, I make every game object keep track of its own state! If we had a billion asteroids and one ship, we might look into structuring this storage differently (say, with a vector of all the positions)\n",
    "- `move()` is thread-safe. When we `turn()` the spaceship, we need to make sure it doesn't interfere with the game logic of moving it!\n",

    "2. Make the world responsible for checking collisions *AND* for updating the cars according to the program\n",
    "    * Pros: might be neater, bc you don't need to communicate as much (the world has all the state)\n",
