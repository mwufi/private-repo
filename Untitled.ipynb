    "1. Suppose you have an arbitrary global variable which is a binary 2-dimensional array called M. A “path” to (i, j) is defined as a sequence of right and down steps starting from position (0, 0) to (i, j) going only through positions which contain a 1. Write a function which returns the number of unique paths to an arbitrary position (i, j). By convention, the number of paths to (0, 0) is 1. What is the computational complexity of your algorithm? What is the memory complexity?"
